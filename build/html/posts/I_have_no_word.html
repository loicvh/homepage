<style> .red {color:#aa0060; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px} </style>
<style> .blue {color:#023891; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px} </style><p>Words, and more specifically their meaning, have always raised debates and questions among philosophers and other thinkers. This is one of the reason why philosophy often seems difficult to grasp, the sentences are long and the word tedious; this is because philosophers want to be <em>right</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Precision</strong> and <strong>accuracy</strong> are required to explain the challenging concepts and ideas that we encounter every day or that pop into our minds. How, using words, would you describe precisely and accurately:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The difference between the <span class="red">red</span> and <span class="blue">blue</span> colours;</li>
<li>The feelings towards loved ones;</li>
<li>The comfort of being in your warm bed when the thunder rumbles and the rain hits the windows;</li>
<li>The parfume of freshly cut grass.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, it is possible to give <em>some</em> interpretations to these examples. One could say that <em>“blue is more deep than red”</em>, or “<em>freshly cut grass smell like spring</em>” but these descriptions are neither precise nor accurate.</p>
<p>In the following, let us try to speak of <em>semantic</em>, and maybe the link with the mathematics.</p>
<p>As a good mathematician or as a good semanticist (semantician?), let us define <em>what is</em> semantic. According to wikipedia,</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">Semantic</p>
<p>Semantics (from Ancient Greek: σημαντικός sēmantikós, “significant”) is the linguistic and philosophical study of meaning in language, programming languages, formal logic, and semiotics.
It is concerned with the relationship between signifiers—like words, phrases, signs, and symbols—and what they stand for in reality, their denotation.</p>
</div>
<p>Equipped with this definition, let’s look at why this relationship is not working as expected.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-inherent-problem-of-the-language">
<h2>The inherent problem of the language<a class="headerlink" href="#the-inherent-problem-of-the-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let us first try to understand <em>what are the issues of the words we use</em>. It seems clear, and we will try to look at this issue as a mathematician later on, that we do not have enough words to describe the infinite realities we experiment. Is a wooden chair the same object as a plastic chair? Are these two chairs exactly equivalent? It seems wrong to call both of these “chair”, while they obviously are not a hundred percent equal.</p>
<p>The second issue is due to context, words have different meanings in different region of the world or at different time; “loyalty” is probably a different concept now than it was in the Middle Ages, “brother” has different meaning depending on the community.</p>
<p>Another issue, linked to the first one, is the multi-meaning nature of the words. A letter is one-in-26, or received in the mail.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">Letter vs. letter</p>
<p>When I say: <em>“I love reading letters”</em>, you have <strong>no</strong> way of knowing which letters I am talking about. You could <em>guess</em> with the context but you are never sure.</p>
</div>
<p>Another problem, which has been raised several times, is the issue of traduction. Translator will wittingly or unwittingly introduce different meaning in the translated version. This explains why some people learn German – or any other language – with the acknowledge aim of reading the <em>true</em> word of Kant or Nietzsche.</p>
<p>This list is obviously not exhaustive and many more communication problem can be linked with the limitation of our languages. Let us see some of the workaround that has been used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-tricks-to-limit-the-misunderstanding">
<h2>Some tricks to limit the misunderstanding<a class="headerlink" href="#some-tricks-to-limit-the-misunderstanding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To address this inherent problem of our limited language, philosophers <em>define</em> – or at least try to define – what they mean with the words they use.</p>
<p>In “What is authority” from <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>, Hannah Arendt starts by explaining what <em>was</em> and what <em>is not</em> authority. Her idea is first to deconstruct what the reader thinks of the authority. After this <em>tabula rasa</em> and on fresh basis, it is easier to explain the concept. In a similar way, Socrates usually begins his elenchus with “<em>what is</em>”, which has been seen as a search of a formal definition of the studied concept, <em>e.g.</em>, “what is piety?” <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a>. In this way, the interlocutor realized that he did not grasp the <em>true</em> concept of piety.</p>
<p>A straight forward way of dealing with disambiguation is to use formal definitions. In the first page of the introduction of “<em>The Critique of Pure Reason</em>”, Immanuel Kant already describes what he exactly meant by “<em>a priori</em> knowledge”:</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">Kant’s definition of ‘<em>a priori</em> knowledge’</p>
<p>In this book, therefore, I will understand by ‘<em>a priori</em> knowledge’ not knowledge that comes independently of this or that experience, but rather what occurs absolutely independently of all experience. Opposed to it there is empirical knowledge, i.e. knowledge that is possible only <em>a posteriori</em>, through experience. An item of <em>a priori</em> knowledge is called ‘pure’ if nothing empirical is mixed into it. The proposition ‘Every alteration has its cause’ is an <em>a priori</em> proposition, but it isn’t pure because the concept of alteration has to be taken from experience <a class="footnote-reference" href="#kant-critique" id="id3">[3]</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>From the beginning, Kant is afraid that the reader does not understand correctly his words, which have already been translated here.</p>
<p>A third way of making sure that the correct message get passed is to create word or to use word from another language. This explains strange words – often inspired from ancient Greek – as the cogito, the conatus, the logos, the monad, and so on. Starting from such a word, the reader <strong>must</strong> use the definition given by the author with no other connotation.</p>
<p>More recently the massive use of social media, and henceforth written conversations, surges the need of a way of disambiguate our messages; this leads to the smiley. A simple character can make the clear distinction between the following sentences.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I am going to the hospital! :)</li>
<li>I am going to the hospital. :(</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that here punctuation has also a role in the appeared meaning of the sentence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-the-limited-power-of-the-language">
<h2>On the limited power of the language<a class="headerlink" href="#on-the-limited-power-of-the-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the following, we will try to prove the following proposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Proposition 1 (P1): Written languages consisted of a given alphabet cannot explain unambiguously any concept</strong></div></blockquote>
<p>Note that as rigorous we would like to be, this proposition can not be proven: if (P1) is true than the (written) proof (in English) will be ambiguous. Let us try to give some intuition about why this is probably true.</p>
<div class="section" id="on-the-countability-of-words">
<h3>On the countability of words<a class="headerlink" href="#on-the-countability-of-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using the 26 letters of the latin alphabet, it is possible to build <em>a lot</em> of words. “Chair” is a valid word, as is “Chiar”, and “Chaaaaaaaaair”, and provided that we chose a meaning to these words. It seems fair that an <em>infinite</em> number of words can be constructed. But how large is this infinity?</p>
<div class="section" id="infinity-in-arithmetic">
<h4>Infinity in arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#infinity-in-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In mathematics, infinities can be smaller than others. For instance, we can distinct countably infinite set and uncountably infinite set. An example of the first one is “the set of even numbers”, and an example of the second one is “the set of real number between 0 and 1”. More specifically, we say that a set is countably infinite if there is a one-to-one <em>correspondence</em> – or bijection – between this set and the set of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, …), and we say that a set X is uncountably infinite if there is no one-to-one <em>function</em> – or injection between X  and the set of natural numbers.</p>
<p>Proving that the set of even number, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span>, is countable is really easy and the bijection is the following: it suffices to match every positive even number to itself and every negative even number to its opposite minus one.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}f: E \to \mathbb{N} : n \mapsto     \begin{cases}
  0, &amp; \text{if}\ n=0; \\
  n, &amp; \text{else if n even;} \\
  -n-1, &amp; \text{else.}
\end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Computing the first elements of the bijection gives</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span></th>
<th class="head"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>-2</td>
<td>1</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>-4</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>4</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The proof of the second proposition is a bit more tedious and relies on Cantor’s diagonal argument, which is a bit similar to the Russel’s paradox. Expressed in a very informal way, this gives the barber paradox:</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">The barber paradox.</p>
<p>The barber is the “one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves”. The question is, does the barber shave himself?</p>
</div>
<p>This question is unsatisfiable and the proposition of the existence of such a barber must be false. With this idea kept in mind, let us prove that the set of real number between 0 and 1 is not countable.</p>
<p>Let us assume by contradiction that this set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([0, 1]\)</span> is in fact countable. Therefore, it exists a bijection and its inverse</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{N} : n \mapsto f(n)\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f^{-1}: \mathbb{N} \to [0, 1] : x \mapsto f^{-1}(x)\]</div>
<p>Writing a similar table as before, we would have something like the following</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="46%" />
<col width="54%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span></th>
<th class="head"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([0,1]\)</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>0</td>
<td>0.<strong>9</strong>184919…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>1</td>
<td>0.5<strong>8</strong>03284…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>2</td>
<td>0.82<strong>2</strong>7340…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>3</td>
<td>0.622<strong>7</strong>448…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>4</td>
<td>0.7210<strong>3</strong>96…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The idea now is to consider the real number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c \in [0, 1]\)</span> which consists of the elements “on the diagonal”, the elements in bold. From this number, 0.98273…, we construct another number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{c} \in [0, 1]\)</span> by incrementing each digit: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{c}=0.09384\)</span>. This number cannot in any line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> of the array since by construction, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n-\)</span>th digit will be different. Remembering the barber paradox, the question here is not “Who shaves the barber?” but “Which number counts <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{c}\)</span>?”. As we found a contradiction, our hypothesis on the countability of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([0, 1]\)</span> must be false, and therefore this set is uncountable.</p>
