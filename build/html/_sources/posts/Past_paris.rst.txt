In 1721, Montesquieu published an epistolary novel "Persian Letters", which describes French society from the eyes of Persian. The book is full of satires, and one of them -- about Parisian -- was worth sharing.

In the letter XXIV, the character Rica wrote to his friend Ibben:

.. topic:: Letter XXIV:

    You will scarcely believe that during the month I have been here I have not yet seen any one walking. There is no people in the world who hold more by their vehicles than the French: they run; they fly: the slow carriages of Asia, the measured step of our camels, would put them into a state of coma. As for me, who am not made for such hurry, and who often go a-foot without changing my pace, I am sometimes as mad as a Christian; for, passing over splashing from head to foot, I cannot pardon the elbowings I meet with regularly and periodically. A man, coming up behind me, passes me, and turns me half round; then another, crossing me on the opposite side, spins me suddenly round to my first position. Before I have walked a hundred paces, I am more bruised than if I had gone ten leagues.
