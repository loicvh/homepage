Tight Bounds on Non-convex Dispatches
_____________________________________

Abstract
========
The economic dispatch problem is a major component of power systems and a lot of work has been made to provide fast and robust algorithms to solve the various economic dispatches. In order to capture physical effects such as the power losses of the network or the valve point loading effects in large combined cycle gas turbines, non-convex models are also considered. However, such additions to the model make the convergence analysis more tedious and few methods actually provide insights on the global optimality of the returned solution. In this work, we show how to efficiently provide lower and upper bounds to a non-convex economic dispatch problem. The method developed here is applied on intensively studied test cases and gives information on how close to the global optimal solution the available literature is.
