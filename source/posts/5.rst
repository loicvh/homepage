A non-Euclidean Sokoban
=======================

A `Sokoban <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoba://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban>`_ is a puzzle video game where the user has to push boxes at the right place. You can find a famous instance `here <https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/sokoban.html>`_, but what happens when you are playing in a non-Euclidean space? 

You'll find it in `Alex Lang's instance <https://sokyokuban.com>`_... Enjoy!
